## What are HD Online Player Features?
 
HD online player features are the ability to play back your edited videos in high definition on your web browser or upload them to online platforms such as YouTube or Vimeo. These features are useful if you want to share your videos with friends, family, or the world, or if you want to watch them on different devices without losing quality. However, not all video formats are supported by HD online players, and some of them require additional codecs or plugins to work properly.
